## Make WSJ & NYTimes and Estadão Great Again:

#### Get around the paywall for many Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Financial Times and Brazilian News Estadao.com.br content
*  **Reference**: The logic is copied from [wsj-walljumper](https://github.com/hatboysam/wsj-walljumper)

#### For New York Times:
*  **Fact**: NYTimes pops up subscription window and blocks content view after you read 10 pieces/month, clearly they use Javascript to do the trick.

*  **Idea**:  Block those Javascript files from downloading :)

*  **Sugggestion For NYTimes Developers**: concatenate the minified Javascript files, and maybe attach a random string in your concatenated Javascript filename?

### Install Instructions
